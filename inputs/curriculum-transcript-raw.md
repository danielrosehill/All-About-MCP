# MCP Curriculum - Raw Transcript

So today has been a day where I've done a lot of these audio recordings for use in repositories, which is a method that I've been exploring, And I figured I might as well actually just use this to quickly define the curriculum, because I love to generate this overnight and then tomorrow spend some time listening to it. That's my plan at least. And this is the curriculum approximately in the AI generated book, course book providing an overview to MCP, because I was looking at videos on MCP on YouTube and kind of the whole kind of idea here is, you frequently run into an endless stream of the same content like introduction to MCP. that isn't really sort of useful for me at the moment, But I do have specific questions. But I think, to organize this properly and somewhat coherently, I'll just describe the approximate structure to be followed in the curriculum. So let's start with, of course, what is MCP? Model Context Protocol? MCP is really not that old. In fact we just had the one year birthday of MCP. So I'm not overly familiar with its actual origin story, Other than knowing that Anthropik came up with it, but I'm sure there's more to it than that. I'm sure it was more than one person at Anthropik who came up with the idea or worked on its initial implementation. So that's important ground to cover. But it's also important ground to cover is alternative approaches. I'm sure, like any advance in technology, there's been debates and differences of opinion regarding what actually is the best way to allow agents to act upon external systems, And I know just from seeing threads on Twitter that there is some controversy around MCP. Some people are like this is the most ridiculous, bloated protocol, unnecessary. It's just an API. Why do we need another thing around an API? That can come about later in the book or the coursework or the document. So, starting from that point, about what is MCP and how did it come to being, it would be good to talk about alternative systems there, And I'm just looking up a couple of terms you'll come across Server sent events, SSE and STDIO, Two mechanisms- And this is moving so fast that I can never remember which is now kind of mostly deprecated. SSE is the older one, Okay, So SSE is deprecated mostly. The direction is moving towards STDIO. Either way, we have remote versus local MCP. That's just a very fundamental distinction And I guess it would be good to talk about that in terms of why sometimes you'll commonly find the same service has a remote and a local MCP. Why? Why would people want to use a local MCP when they could use it remotely? Some MCPs are local only for obvious reasons, Like it's a, it's a just created an MCP for my NAS, which is a local MCP. But in other cases- probably in most cases- there's a question regarding it's not so clear cut why one would choose one over the other, And frequently they're offered in parallel, which I think kind of adds to the confusion about MCP, of which there is a lot. So the other question- I think a very important part of the picture here- and the question is regarding security. Clearly, MCP is a potential, potentially massive risk. Typically, authentication is handled by, you know, at the API level. We understand that. What happens when suddenly you've got a bunch of GitHub MCPs and you don't know which one is legit, which one isn't? I mean, maybe that's a bad example. GitHub it's have an official MCP, But in other cases there's like kind of third party ones And you think, wait, if I provide, if I'm putting my API key into connecting to this remote MCP, that sounds very risky. So that kind of MCP security basically is a very key one And another concept that I think could be very useful is the kind of booming scene of MCP registries. Smithery, GitHub have one, Everyone and their grandmother seems to be coming out with an MCP registry, Adding again another layer of confusion for users who are trying to figure out. wait, do I want the GitHub registry? Another major issue. I mean, I guess we don't want to talk too much about the issues. It's different. What you'll commonly see is different tools all have their own MCP definitions. So, like VS Code, Klein, Rue Code, they all want their own MCP file. Winsurf And I started using lately a good tool called MCPM. There's an MCP manager and a proxy And it's unfortunate that that is necessary. And I guess it begs the question: why do we see so much kind of splintering? Why are all these? why is? why is it that these different tools are insisting on their own libraries and developers are having to kind of say this is ridiculous. we're going to create these tools, we're going to create a single management interface to proxy that. But why is it that the why do we see these kind of proprietary, these proprietary systems emerging over how developers define the MCP tools that they use? Why haven't we seen standardization around a central sort of management And there's one definition on your computer and that's where we expect to find it. So standardization is really key there. I'd say A key point about the MCP picture. I'm thinking through all the things that I've found regarding using MCP myself for a while. It's cumbersome, but once you get the hang of it it's brilliant. I mean, I really think it's potentially fantastic. It is a fantastic technology, Just mired in a lot of early stage confusion. Now I guess criticisms of MCP and benefits pros and cons would be good to cover. Like the pros, I think, are quite straightforward, but maybe some less obvious ones, Obvious ones being: it's great that you can get your chatbot to send an email from you, from your account. What else can we do? A very interesting one in agentic AI is payments Giving agents wallets. What else can we give them through MCP? Where are the limits? We would kind of tend towards saying that MCP can allow agents to interact with everything with an API. Where does that stop? That's technical systems. but what are the kind of edge, far edge, most ambitious things we can think of, The boldest, far reaches of? what could MCP really do If the nuclear codes had an API? you know crazy example Could it launch, I don't know- operational technology, OT, SCADA systems in offline environments, Any potential there? I don't know why I thought of those in most secure computing environments. Then let's talk about vendors and I guess just the picture who's emerging in MCP- Anthropa came up with it. I thought it was a pivotal moment when OpenAI kind of said we're going to support MCP. I would say it was a concession, so much as I thought it was a good thing actually that another major vendor and a rival said, okay, this is a good thing, We're not going to come up with our own. OpenAI comes up with a better MCP. but this is a good point to talk about that. Are there any alternatives? Here's one question I'd like to discuss in this text somewhere. Something I've done with my agents is: take a CLI like GH for GitHub or Hugging Face. It's very well documented and it's actually in knowledge for most agents or most large language models. So before I kind of figured out the basics of MCP, I would say in a system prompt, here's, there's GH and use it to manage GitHub. And it actually just worked. So that kind of led me a time to ask myself: hang on a second. Why don't we just provide a better way for AI tools to look up command line interfaces, And that whole field is emerging with tools like context seven, And for me that kind of begs the question: why don't we just do this? Instead of every single API coming up with this own MCP, why don't we just have like one API like context seven that gathers together all the documentation and then we won't need hundreds and hundreds of MCPs in parallel to APIs. So I think that's kind of a thoughtful question to be to be considered there. And then at the more technical level, we'll talk about MCP, proxying, MCP gateways, which are emerging and important. So I'm working on a project in the, in the companies of tomorrow, where MCP has some name that people are familiar with. Connectors is kind of emerging as one And again the company says: welcome to Acme Limited, on your first day, Daniel, We're glad to connect you to. and instead of now where they say here's your email account or whatever, or here's our Slack, They'll say here's the, here's our in-house AI tool And this is your. I don't know, it'd be like a hologram or something at that point: Here's your uh pass key to the MCP. Um, so that kind of everyone has kind of working in in knowledge economy has a parallel personal digital life and a work digital life. So, at home, I have my MCPs for, let's say, Spotify or something, and I have my work MCPs. So how's your average knowledge worker tomorrow? Um, I don't see. besides, maybe people work in very secure industries, but let's take the majority of us who don't work in the government sector or whatever and have extraordinary security requirements, And we're probably going to be working from home for the foreseeable future- I don't mean all the time, but just like there'll be some remote work going on And there'll be some need for remote workers to have access to their company's connectors or MCPs, et cetera. And, uh, what are the kind of best practices emerging there in terms of federacy And um? right now I don't think it's really actually even a thing yet, in the sense that MCP isn't developed enough, that we don't. I mean, there's not even really like a decent chatbot for the desktop to size cloud code, I guess, But there's barely one for Android. We're still at a quite early stage, I think, in the overall development, And so I don't think it's really. it won't be a challenge until we're further on And connectors become something that people know about, And today I might say I'm really interested in MCP and get a blank look from everyone except folks interested in AI tech. Um, but you know, maybe a year we can talk. there might be like a market for connectors, might be mainstream, or in five years And um, when we get to that point of, if you get to that point of maturity, um, what would the system look like? Um. one other thing- I think that's already kind of a decent curriculum here- but one other topic is um East versus West in AI. I find very interesting. I find I love to explore the Chinese models on Quen for image generation, for generative AI, And I love to see um how they're doing things differently and be really interesting to uh talk about within MCP, what have been some of the most impressive use cases so far? uh, for maybe any users of AI really, But uh, even if it's oh. that's one final topic actually before I just wrap up is um I've uh developing custom MCPs. I'm beginning to do that, finding it really useful. One challenge is tool definition. Um, the more tools, the more context, And um, I've read- I don't know if it's correct or not- that Anthropic is working on at the protocol level a way to make the tool exposure like very, very defined, So that instead of wrestling to try turning on and off tools like a button, uh, there's going to be a more sophisticated solution And, uh, if that's true, love to learn more about that. And coming back to custom MCPs, which I think would rather not really ever have to create them, to be honest, Um would prefer to have someone has created it and they can just get onto using it, because MCP is just a tool. People don't want to. we're not kind of here to make tools or use tools so much as to do things with our, with these technologies, Um, but of course, there's going to be some MCPs. There are. we'll talk about MCP MCP as being a layer over AI, over APIs, excuse me. Um, then I'm sure that large have mostly worked um, at least in-house, with small to medium companies. but I'm sure enterprises have internal APIs and stuff like that and proprietary systems And in those cases I guess, by extension, they'd want to be creating their own proprietary MCP. So, um, that market for private, non-commercial uh MCPs, Um, and finally, uh, while I'm kind of just expanding here as I go along the curriculum, I've noticed that there is MCPs. can I always assumed whenever I used an MCP, it was either a file system MCP or an A or an authenticated API. And then I used a couple that were just um MCPs over public APIs and authentication needed, Nice and easy to set up And uh, what are some of the that's really useful for, I think large data sets? Think about like stuff like uh UN World Bank data that is already public or I think this is a potential use for great use for it It's already public. There's a lot of great open data initiatives in the world And I think frequently the problem is actually just that like they're doing it. The World Bank is releasing all this data, The OECD is releasing it. They're being transparent, They're doing they are putting it out there onto these data portals. But even if they provide nice visualization and download tools, by itself it's kind of just like it's almost not that helpful. There's just a mountain of information to wade through that they've just kind of put there And I think that the idea that that could be exposed via conversational interfaces is really powerful. So um be interested to know among that sector, the government's government users- um exploring maybe how MCP could be used um as part of uh transparency and uh open data initiatives, Open government. if there's any movement there, I would love to include some of that in the curriculum And that's it. Have fun generating this.
