# Style Guide: MCP Technical Book

This style guide outlines the conventions and standards to be followed in writing a formal technical book about Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 1. Voice and Tone

*   **Formality:** Maintain a formal, yet accessible tone. Avoid colloquialisms, slang, and overly casual language.
*   **Perspective:** Use the third person. Avoid "we" or "you" except in specific circumstances (e.g., quoting someone). The imperative mood is acceptable for instructions.
*   **Enthusiasm:** Avoid excessive enthusiasm or subjective opinions. Present information objectively and let the facts speak for themselves.
*   **Exclamations:** Do not use exclamation marks in the main prose.
*   **Clarity:** Prioritize clarity and precision in explaining technical concepts. Define jargon and potentially unfamiliar terms.

## 2. Terminology Standards

*   **Consistency:** Use MCP-related terminology consistently throughout the book.
*   **Acronyms:** Spell out "Model Context Protocol" on its first use in each chapter, followed by the acronym "MCP" in parentheses. Subsequent references can use the acronym.
*   **Glossary:** Include a comprehensive glossary of technical terms related to MCP and agentic AI at the end of the book.
*   **Competing Terms:** Acknowledge competing terms if they exist, and explain the preferred usage within this book.

## 3. Formatting Conventions

*   **Header Hierarchy:**
    *   `##` Chapter Titles
    *   `###` Major Sections within a Chapter
    *   `####` Subsections
*   **Code Blocks:** Format code blocks using a monospace font and syntax highlighting where appropriate.

    ```python
    # Example code block
    def hello_world():
        print("Hello, world!")
    ```
*   **Examples:** Present examples in a distinct format (e.g., a shaded box or with a clear "Example:" prefix).

    **Example:**
    This is an example of how to use the MCP to send an email.
*   **Figures and Tables:** Number figures and tables sequentially within each chapter (e.g., Figure 2.1, Table 3.2). Include descriptive captions.

## 4. Chapter Structure

*   **Opening:** Start directly with substantive content. Avoid introductory phrases such as "In this chapter, we will..." or welcoming remarks.
*   **Body:** Present concepts in a logical and progressive manner, building upon previously introduced information.
*   **Closing:** Conclude each chapter with a concise summary of the key points covered. Do not include teasers or previews of the next chapter.

## 5. Forbidden Patterns

*   Conversational greetings (e.g., "Hello, everyone!")
*   Second-person address (e.g., "You can see that...")
*   Rhetorical questions as openers (e.g., "What is MCP?")
*   Tutorial/video language (e.g., "click", "scroll", "let's")

## 6. Research Integration

*   **Citation Style:** Use a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, Chicago).
*   **Source Quality:** Prioritize primary sources and reputable publications.
*   **Currency:** Prioritize research and information from 2024 and 2025. Use older sources only for historical context or foundational concepts.
*   **References:** Provide full bibliographic information for all cited sources in a dedicated "References" section at the end of the book.

## 7. Length Guidelines

*   **Chapters:** Ideally between 15-25 pages.
*   **Sections:** No more than 5-7 pages. If a section exceeds this length, consider breaking it down into subsections.
*   **Balance:** Maintain a balance between providing sufficient detail and avoiding unnecessary verbosity.
